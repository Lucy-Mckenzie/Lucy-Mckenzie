# Hi I'm Lucy 👋
I'm a creative Junior Software Developer specializing in React, Typescript, and Node.js. I currently live in New Zealand but will migrate to Australia, my home country, in early January. I am devoted to creating intuitive, efficient, and minimalistic designs. 

## About me 🌱
Recently I completed a 17-week intensive boot camp at Dev Academy, here I developed a strong understanding of modern technologies, working in a real-world environment, and Agile methodologies. I'm driven by my excitement of creating, problem-solving and designing, fueled by my intuitive approach to tackling challenges.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me reading, swimming, or enjoying time with family and friends. I’m a social butterfly at heart, driven by a passion for expanding my knowledge.

## Projects 🔭
We Hike is your go-to app for all things hiking. It provides detailed information on New Zealand's Great Walks, as well as up-to-date hike and hut details sourced directly from the Department of Conservation API. Built with React, Leaflet.js, TypeScript, Node.js, DOC API, and Tailwind CSS. We Hike is a large-scale project showcasing the technologies I mastered during boot camp. This is an ongoing project—check out my progress so far at https://lucy-2024-we-hike.devacademy.nz/.

MyCelium is a game where players grow mushrooms from spores and sell them at the market for profit. Developed over a week with a talented team of six, the game offers an engaging experience as players watch their mushrooms progress through three distinct growth stages. We built this project using React, Phaser.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. MyCelium highlights my collaborative skills and ability to deliver a fully functional application under tight deadlines.
