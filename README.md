# Hi I'm Lucy ðŸ‘‹
I'm a creative Software Developer with a relentless drive to innovate and design minimalistic applications. I currently live in New Zealand but will migrate for the right opportunity. 

## About me ðŸŒ±
Recently I completed a 17-week intensive boot camp at Dev Academy, here I developed a strong understanding of modern technologies, working in a real-world environment, and Agile methodologies. I'm driven by my excitement of creating, problem-solving and designing, fueled by my intuitive approach to tackling challenges.

When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me reading, swimming, or enjoying time with family and friends. Iâ€™m a social butterfly at heart, driven by a passion for expanding my knowledge.
